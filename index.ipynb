    "## Understanding File paths \n",
    "Understanding file paths is crucial for navigating and accessing files on a computer's file system. A file path specifies the location of a file or directory in a hierarchical structure. Here's a brief introduction to file paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Absolute Path**: An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory from the root directory of the file system. It includes the full directory hierarchy necessary to locate the file. For example:\n",
    "   - On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS): `/home/user/documents/file.txt`\n",
    "   - On Windows: `C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\file.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relative Path**: A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not start from the root directory. For example:\n",
    "   - `documents/file.txt`: Relative to the current working directory, assuming the file is located in the `documents` directory.\n",
    "   - `../data/file.txt`: Relative to the parent directory of the current working directory, assuming the file is located in the `data` directory, which is one level above the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Path Components**:\n",
    "   - **Directory**: Part of the path that specifies folders or directories. For example, `/home/user/documents/` or `C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\`.\n",
    "   - **File Name**: The name of the file, such as `file.txt`.\n",
    "   - **Extension**: The part of the file name after the last dot, indicating the file type. For example, `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Special Symbols**:\n",
    "   - **`.` (Dot)**: Represents the current directory.\n",
    "   - **`..` (Double Dot)**: Represents the parent directory.\n",
    "   - ~ **(Tilde)**: Represents the home directory (linux/unix)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Platform Differences**:\n",
    "   - Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) use forward slashes (`/`) as directory separators.\n",
    "   - Windows uses backslashes (`\\`) as directory separators.\n",
    "   - Python provides the `os.path` module, which offers functions to manipulate file paths in a platform-independent manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding file paths allows you to locate, access, and manipulate files and directories programmatically, which is essential for file I/O operations like reading from and writing to files in Python."

    "## File IO\n",
    "\n",
    "File I/O in Python refers to Input/Output operations involving files. It allows you to read from and write to files on your computer's storage. Here's a brief overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening a File**: You start by opening a file using the `open()` function, specifying the file path and the mode ('r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reading from a File**: Once the file is open for reading, you can use various methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to read the content of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing to a File**: When a file is open for writing, you can use the `write()` method to write data to the file. If the file doesn't exist, Python will create it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Appending to a File**: If you want to add content to an existing file, you can open it in append mode ('a') and use the `write()` method to add content at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Closing a File**: It's essential to close the file after you've finished working with it, using the `close()` method. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Context Manager (with Statement)**: Python provides a `with` statement that automatically handles opening and closing files. This ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs."
